### Introduction ###
I have picked the 4th pre-defined project as my Term Project  which is Parking Management System. 
The software is simple; there will be a Panel asks the user if he/she wants to operate the program using 
User Interface or a Command Line Interface. The program will consists of 9 parking slots
(A-B-C 3 of each) . The user will ask the operator to reserve one parking slot for them and the
 slot will be his/her for 2 hours. If the User wants to leave early from obtained parking slot he/she
can inform the Operator and the Operator then release the parking slots and give them a discount 
for the time they did not used for the given park slot. The payment methods will be for
 credit card and cash.

### Objectives ###

==> This software will be designed for Managing the given parking spaces and distributing them to the paying customers.

==> This software will be distributed with both User and Command Line interfaces.

==> This software will contain inheritance, overloading, polymorphism, overriding and exception handling.

==> Upon reserving his/her park slot the User will receive a parking ticket which will consists of a SHA_256 key stored in the program. If the User wants to leave early this key will be used to give the user a discount for the time it is not used.
